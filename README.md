# **Overview**

Our web application is called ***what's Cooking*** and it will help people decide what to cook. The app will highlight randomly generated interesting meals worldwide with a list of ingredients. Upon loading the page, users will see the highlight meal/recipe of the day on the front page. Each meal will feature the necessary ingredients and instructions for preparation. 
Users will be able to create a grocery list and temporarily save it to the age, add a review, and like reviews left on the page. 
We use the TheMealDB API, category: List all Categories, Area, Ingredients.

## **Goals**

This project aims to help people and their families discover new meals, share their experiences with their families, and enjoy eating exotic food.

## **Tech Specificaltion**

We used HTML, CSS, BootStrap 5, and Javascript for this SPA as our technologies. 
We fetched the data using a public API: https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/random.php.
We've included DOM events, "click" for our feedback reviews, and for adding ingredients to the grocery list. "Submit" for when customers leave a review. 

## **Conclusion**

We worked hard to build this application, and We hope you enjoy it and share it with your family and friends. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us. Here's a link to the final deployment.
